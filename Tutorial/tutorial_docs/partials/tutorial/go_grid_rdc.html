<p>
Before you can begin with this tutorial, you need to know the credentials for your servers.
To find these credentials, please log in to your GoGrid console at <a href='http://my.gogrid.com/' target='_BLANK'>my.gogrid.com</a> with the credentials that you used when you set up your account.

This will take you to a screen that shows all of the servers that are in your cluster.  For Remote Desktop, look for the server that is listed as <strong>Windows 2012 Server</strong>.  Take note of the IP address and the server name.  In this case, the server name is tableau1.

Once you have taken note of the name of your Windows Server, click on the Passwords button to see the passwords screen.

The passwords screen shows you the Administrator username, and the corresponding password.  Use these values in your Remote Desktop client to connect to your virtual machine running Tableau Desktop.
