<p>To get started with building a dashboard with Hue, click on the pen icon.</p>

<p>This will take you into the edit-mode where you can choose different widgets and layouts that you would like to see.  You can choose a number of options and configurations here, but for now, just drag a barchart into the top gray row.</p>

<p>This will bring up the list of fields that are present in our index so that you can choose which field you would like to group by.  Let's choose <strong>request_date</strong>.</p>

<p>For the sake of our display, choose +15MINUTES for the INTERVAL.</p>

<p>You aren't limited to a single column, you can view this as a two-column display as well.  Select the two-column layout from the top left.</p>

<p>While you're here, let's drag a pie chart to the newly created row in the left column.</p>

<p><img src="media/hue_db_5.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>This time, let's choose <strong>department</strong> as the field that we want to group by for our pie chart.</p>

<p><img src="media/hue_db_6.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Things are really starting to take shape!  Let's add a <strong>Facet filter</strong> to the left hand side, and select <strong>product</strong> as the facet.</p>

<p>Now that we are satisfied with our changes, let's click on the pencil icon to exit edit mode.</p>
